  Werey, make sure you read this oo. This go be like reference for us as we
dey work. I'll put all necessary colours(rgb, rgba, hex codes) here and so would you. This way we can easily keep track of everything we do and make sure that it remains consistent everywhere in the site.


  Abeg know that everything here is subject to review. We can always change 
anything and everything if it doesn't go down well with either of us(of course after consultation with one another)

  Enough talking, now let's get into this!!!


                                  COLOURS
  I was looking for colours that portrayed our status as 
(i) royalty and nobility in Christ 
(ii) soldiers in the battle between Light and Darkness
(iii) and the flame burning in us to fufill the Great Commission as well as youthful vibrance

  After considering I chose purple(i), blue(i and ii) and a shade of orange(iii).

  In order not to allow the site look like the drawing book of a 3-year old, I
decided to use purple(and white) as the primary colours, blue as secondary and orange as accent colour(for buttons).
